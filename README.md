## The Challenge

Create a sign-up page for a new app
The app uses [material-ui](https://material-ui.com).
Here is a [link](https://marvelapp.com/ca2366h/screen/60199312/handoff) to a design mock-up
Notice:
- This is **just a Front-End** (no need to actually perform a sign-up)
- Please implement **just** the sing-up. **no need to create the sign-in / tabs**
- There are **3** screenshots in the mock-up
- Make the screens **as close as possible to the design** (write in a comment if you have any known difference / limitation between code and design)
- Check for errors when going out of focus or when clicking the button. There are 2 types of error messages: 
	- Error message when **a field is left empty**
	- Error message when **the content is not valid**
	
## Scoring System

- Perfect design (margins, fonts, texts, sizes) - **20%**
- Using React/Material Ui when needed - **10%**
- Clean code (readable and reuseable) - **10%**
- Proactive (Is something missing in the requirements?) - **10%**

Task should take about **60 min**

# Good Luck!

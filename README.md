## The Challenge

Create a sign-in / sign-up page for a new app
The app uses [material-ui](https://material-ui.com).
Here is a [link](https://marvelapp.com/ca2366h/screen/60199312/handoff) to a design mock-up
Notice:
- This is just a FE (no need to actually perform a sign-in / sign-up)
- There are **4** screens in the mock-up
- Make the screens as close as possible to the design (write in a comment if you have any known difference / limitation between code and design)
- Check for errors when going out of focus or when clicking the button. There are 2 types of error messages: 
	- Error message when a field is left empty
	- Error message when the content is not valid
	
## Scoring System
- A solution that works - **50%**
- Perfect design (margins, fonts, texts, sizes) - **20%**
- Using React/Material Ui when needed - **10%**
- Clean code (readable and reuseable) - **10%**
- Proactive (Is something missing in the requirements?) - **10%**

# Good Luck!
